# Deliverable-1
My project aims to create a smart obstacle-avoidance car to navigate its environment independently by recognizing and avoiding impediments, resulting in smooth, safe, and efficient movement. This functionality is often accomplished via sensors, control algorithms, and motors, allowing the car to be able to sense the environment, make independent decisions and lastly act on those decisions.
